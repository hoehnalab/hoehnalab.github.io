We are thrilled to celebrate Priscila for successfully completing her masterâ€™s degree in our lab!
She was a student from the <a href="https://ees.bio.lmu.de/">Evolution, Ecology and Systematics (EES) </a> program at LMU.
She recently presented her thesis, "The State-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model", where she introduced a novel approach for the joint inference of discrete regime history and continuous trait adaptation.

Her work contributes valuable insights to the field, and we are incredibly proud of her accomplishments. Congratulations, Priscila! We look forward to seeing where your research journey takes you next.
