We are proud to celebrate Bjørn for successfully completing his PhD thesis!

Bjørn defended his thesis, **'Efficient inference of clade-specific diversification rates using proabilistic approaches'**, marking the culmination of years of work at the intersection of biology, mathematics, and computer science.

His research work paints a dynamic picture of evolution, showing that the diversification rates are far from constant and are particularly volatile in younger lineages.
Beyond the biology, his rigorous work on identifiability has set a new standard for how we interpret these complex models.

We will miss his sharp quantitative mind and his collegiality in the lab. Congratulations, Bjørn!
We look forward to seeing where your research journey takes you next.
