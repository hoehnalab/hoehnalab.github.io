We are excited to announce the publication of our lab's latest research, **"The Effects of Cryptic Diversity on Diversification Dynamics Analyses in Crocodylia,"**.
In which [Gustavo](/people/) and [Sebastian](/people/) explore how previously unrecognized cryptic diversity influences diversification rate estimates in crocodylians.
This study demonstrates that incorporating cryptic species into phylogenetic analyses reveals increasing speciation rates towards the present‚Äîchallenging previous assumptions of long-term low net-diversification rates in Crocodylia.
This work highlights the importance of accounting for cryptic diversity in macroevolutionary studies and encourages further research using genomic data to refine diversification analyses.

Additionally, the cover of the journal issue includes a picture of *Osteolaemus tetraspis* that Gustavo photographed in the Munich zoo.
