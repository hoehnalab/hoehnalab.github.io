We are thrilled to celebrate Walker for successfully completing his masterâ€™s degree in our lab!
He is a student from the <a href="https://www.mgap.geo.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">Master program "Geobiology and Paleobiology" (MGAP)</a> at LMU.
He recently presented his thesis, "Can polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models improve inference with discrete morphological data?", where he introduced a novel approach for accounting for polymorphisms during phylogenetic tree inference using discrete morphological datasets.

His work contributes valuable insights to the field, and we are incredibly proud of his accomplishments. Congratulations, Walker! We look forward to seeing where your research journey takes you next.
