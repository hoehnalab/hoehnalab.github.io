            I’m a computational biologist with focus on Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Natural selection by means of adaptation and genetic inheritance are key principles in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary relationships are commonly depicted by phylogenetic trees. Using phylogenetic methods we can learn about the evolutionary history of species and the processes that have contributed to present diversity. I’m developing statistical and computational methods to infer phylogenies from molecular sequence data. These methods additionally identify periods of adaptive genetic evolution at lineage or genes. Furthermore, I develop mathematical models to study macroevolutionary patterns, such as, diversification rate variation over time and among lineages and episodes of global mass extinctions.

I am a paleontologist and evolutionary biologist investigating how biological diversity evolves in concert with changes in the Earth system, mainly focusing on fishes. My research explores how fossils reveal fundamental and entirely unexpected aspects of the evolutionary history of living organisms, and examines diversity and biogeographic patterns through the lens of paleontological data. I am also interested in how sampling and coding of morphological data impacts phylogenetic inference and the estimation of evolutionary timescales.

I’m a vertebrate paleontologist working on macroevolution of crocodylomorphs (group that also includes living crocodilians). My research is dedicated to a critical reassessment of paleontological and neontological data to be subsequently incorporated into analyses that combine morphological, molecular and stratigraphic (fossil age) data simultaneously (total-evidence tip dating). The focus of my studies is to provide more rigorous time-scaled phylogenies in order to better understanding macroevolutionary processes underlying crocodylomorph evolutionary history.

I am an evolutionary biologist who is interested in estimating speciation- and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees. In my research, I have been investigating the challenge associated with non-identifiability in the time-variable reconstructed birth-death model, as presented by Louca & Pennell (2020) in Nature. Specifically, we have found that rapidly changing speciation and extinction rates can be robustly inferred in spite of non-identifiability. Additionally, I am working on developing a fast algorithm for a lineage-specific birth-death model with finite categories, which is used to infer shifts in rates along the phylogeny. Previously, this model has relied on Monte Carlo methods for estimating the rate and number of shifts along each branch. With our new approach, we do not need to use the Monte Carlo approach. Consequently, our method is much faster, there is no stochasticity in the estimation procedure, and we can readily fit the lineage-specific birth-death model to large trees with tens of thousands of taxa. My other interests include data mining using natural language processing, brain size evolution and phylogenetic comparative models of adaptation. My favorite organisms are bryozoans and ruminants!
